# `Items` CRUD RESTful API

This is a NestJS application I built while following Brad Traversy's **awesome** crash course on the technology, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqhNoDE6pb4&t=1514s).

I also documented the steps I took to get to the current state (finished ? ? ) of the app by adding screenshots and some comments.

I am making publicly available my notes in case anyone wants to take a look at them and not willing to spend 1 hour on the vid:
